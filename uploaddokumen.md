Feature Implementation: PDF Upload and Processing

Overview
We aim to enhance our application by enabling users to upload PDF files alongside existing image formats (JPEG and PNG). Additionally, once a PDF is uploaded, it should be processed by our selected Language Learning Model (LLM) for further analysis or actions. This feature will involve updates to both the frontend and backend components, ensuring seamless integration with our existing infrastructure, including Supabase for storage and our LLM for processing.

Objectives
- Extend File Upload Capabilities: Modify existing upload functionalities to accept PDF files.
- Validate PDF Files: Ensure uploaded PDFs meet size and format requirements.
- Store PDFs in Supabase: Upload and manage PDF files using Supabase Storage.
- Integrate LLM Processing: Automatically send uploaded PDFs to the LLM for processing.
- Handle Responses and Errors: Manage successful processing and handle any errors gracefully.
- Update User Interface: Allow users to upload PDFs and view processing results.

Tasks Breakdown
1. Update Environment Configuration
   - Responsible: Junior Engineer 1
   - Description: Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly set for PDF processing and storage.
   - Steps:
     - Review .env.local to confirm Supabase keys and LLM API keys are present.
     - Add any additional environment variables if required for PDF processing.
   - Notes:
     - Ensure that sensitive information remains secure and is not exposed in version control.

2. Modify Backend Upload Validation
   - Responsible: Junior Engineer 2
   - Description: Update the file upload validation schema to accept PDF files.
   - Steps:
     - Locate the Upload Schema: Open app/(chat)/api/files/upload/route.ts.
     - Update the FileSchema.
   -    import { z } from 'zod';

   const FileSchema = z.object({
     file: z
       .instanceof(Blob)
       .refine((file) => file.size <= 5 * 1024 * 1024, {
         message: 'File size should be less than 5MB',
       })
       .refine((file) => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'].includes(file.type), {
         message: 'File type should be JPEG, PNG, or PDF',
       }),
   });:
     - Adjust the file size limit if necessary to accommodate larger PDFs.
     - Ensure that only necessary file types are allowed to maintain security.

3. Update File Upload Endpoint to Handle PDFs
   - Responsible: Junior Engineer 2
   - Description: Ensure the backend correctly handles PDF uploads and stores them in Supabase.
   - Steps:
     - Modify the Upload Function: In lib/supabase.ts, ensure the retryUpload function correctly handles PDF files.
        export async function uploadFileToSupabase(file: File): Promise<string> {
     try {
       const filename = `${Date.now()}-${file.name}`;
       const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin.storage
         .from('documents') // Use a separate bucket for documents
         .upload(filename, file, {
           cacheControl: '3600',
           upsert: false,
         });

       if (error) {
         throw error;
       }

       const publicUrl = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1/object/public/documents/${data.path}`;
       return publicUrl;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error uploading file to Supabase:', error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
     - Ensure Supabase Bucket Exists: Verify that a documents bucket exists in Supabase Storage. If not, create one with appropriate public access settings.
   - Notes:
     - Using separate buckets for images and documents helps in organizing files.
     - Adjust bucket names and access policies as per project requirements.

4. Enhance Frontend File Input to Accept PDFs

        <input
     type="file"
     className="fixed -top-4 -left-4 size-0.5 opacity-0 pointer-events-none"
     ref={fileInputRef}
     multiple
     accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png,.pdf" // Added .pdf
     onChange={handleFileChange}
     tabIndex={-1}
   />
     - Provide User Feedback for PDF Uploads: Update any UI elements to indicate successful PDF uploads. Optionally, display a PDF icon or preview.
   - Notes:
     - Ensure that the UI remains intuitive when handling multiple file types.
     - Consider file type-specific previews for a better user experience.

5. Integrate PDF Processing with LLM
   - Responsible: Junior Engineer 4
   - Description: After uploading a PDF, automatically send it to the LLM for processing.
   - Steps:
     - Create an API Route for LLM Processing: Create a new file app/(chat)/api/llm/process-pdf.ts.
        import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
   import { supabaseAdmin } from '@/lib/supabase';
   import { processPdfWithLLM } from '@/lib/llm'; // Assume this is a utility function

   export async function POST(request: Request) {
     try {
       const { url } = await request.json();

       if (!url) {
         return NextResponse.json({ error: 'URL is required' }, { status: 400 });
       }

       // Send the PDF URL to the LLM for processing
       const llmResponse = await processPdfWithLLM(url);

       return NextResponse.json({ data: llmResponse });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error processing PDF with LLM:', error);
       return NextResponse.json({ error: 'LLM processing failed' }, { status: 500 });
     }
   }
     - Implement the LLM Processing Function: In lib/llm.ts, add the processPdfWithLLM function.
        import fetch from 'node-fetch';

   export async function processPdfWithLLM(pdfUrl: string): Promise<any> {
     const response = await fetch('https://api.your-llm-provider.com/process', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`, // Example for OpenAI
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({ url: pdfUrl }),
     });

     if (!response.ok) {
       throw new Error(`LLM processing failed: ${response.statusText}`);
     }

     const data = await response.json();
     return data;
   }
     - Update File Upload Handler to Trigger LLM Processing: Modify components/multimodal-input.tsx to send the uploaded PDF URL to the LLM.
        const handleFileChange = useCallback(
     async (event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
       const files = Array.from(event.target.files || []);
       setUploadQueue(files.map((file) => file.name));

       try {
         const uploadPromises = files.map((file) => uploadFile(file));
         const uploadedAttachments = await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
         const successfullyUploadedAttachments = uploadedAttachments.filter(
           (attachment) => attachment !== undefined,
         );

         // Process each uploaded file with LLM
         const llmPromises = successfullyUploadedAttachments.map(async (attachment) => {
           if (attachment.contentType === 'application/pdf') {
             const response = await fetch('/api/llm/process-pdf', {
               method: 'POST',
               headers: {
                 'Content-Type': 'application/json',
               },
               body: JSON.stringify({ url: attachment.url }),
             });
             const result = await response.json();
             return { ...attachment, llmData: result.data };
           }
           return attachment;
         });

         const attachmentsWithLLM = await Promise.all(llmPromises);

         setAttachments((currentAttachments) => [
           ...currentAttachments,
           ...attachmentsWithLLM,
         ]);
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error uploading or processing files!', error);
       } finally {
         setUploadQueue([]);
       }
     },
     [setAttachments],
   );
   - :
     - Replace 'https://api.your-llm-provider.com/process' with the actual endpoint of your LLM provider.
     - Ensure that the LLM can handle PDF URLs and process them accordingly.
     - Handle sensitive data securely, especially when interacting with third-party APIs.

6. Update Supabase Storage Rules (If Necessary)

     <div key={attachment.name} className="attachment-item">
       {attachment.contentType === 'application/pdf' ? (
         <a href={attachment.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
           <span>ðŸ“„ {attachment.name}</span>
         </a>
       ) : (
         <img src={attachment.url} alt={attachment.name} className="attachment-image" />
       )}
       {attachment.llmData && (
         <div className="llm-result">
           {/* Display LLM processing results */}
           <pre>{JSON.stringify(attachment.llmData, null, 2)}</pre>
         </div>
       )}
     </div>
   ))}
     - Provide Upload Status Indicators: Show loading indicators while files are uploading or being processed. Display success or error messages based on the upload and processing outcomes.
